# Workspace Access Management Facade Task

Status: backend and owner-facing UX implemented; multi-account proof pending
Date: 2026-07-22

## Goal

Give workspace owners one BunkFy API for operational access profiles, member assignments, and Staff join sources without exposing GMA module administration APIs or leaking BunkFy policy into reusable modules.

## Ownership

- GMA AccessControl owns generic profile state, optimistic versions, allowed permission registration, assignment history, anti-escalation, and exact-scope reconciliation.
- GMA Organizations owns invitation and enrollment-link secrets, lifecycle, owner authorization, expiry, claim limits, and membership governance.
- BunkFy Workspaces owns product role names, permission labels and dependencies, protected seeds, delegable permission policy, property plans, join-source summaries, and operator workflows.
- Staff remains the employment authority. The facade may correlate existing public contracts but does not copy Staff profile state into Workspaces.

## Invariants

- The ambient workspace scope is authoritative. Route or body organization ids cannot select another tenant.
- The authenticated subject is resolved on the server and passed to every generic management contract.
- The product permission catalogue is the intersection of active GMA permissions and BunkFy's explicit delegable allowlist.
- Profile writes reject unknown, non-delegable, or dependency-incomplete permission sets before dispatch.
- Seed profile keys remain present and identifiable. Owners may tune their permissions, but cannot archive them through the product facade.
- Assignment replacement is exact-scope and anti-escalating. The target must remain an ordinary member of the same workspace; owner governance access is never edited through this flow.
- Join-source list responses contain lifecycle facts and sanitized BunkFy plan summaries, never token digests or plaintext secrets.
- Revocation and replacement are deny-first. A replacement source is minted only after the previous source is denied or confirmed unusable, and uses a caller-supplied idempotency id through the existing issuance facade.
- Plaintext join tokens are returned only by the successful creation call. Exact retries never mint another source and never replay the token; a lost token requires an explicit new replacement.
- Organizations governance remains owner-only in this slice. Operational custom profiles do not silently grant invitation approval or ownership powers.

## Delivery

1. Add product DTOs and a grouped permission catalogue with labels, descriptions, risk hints, and dependencies.
2. Add a Contracts-only Workspaces application facade for profile list/create/update/archive and exact member assignment reads/reconciliation.
3. Add paged invitation/enrollment list, revoke/disable, and deny-first replacement operations composed from Organizations Contracts and Workspaces plans.
4. Expose tenant-required BunkFy endpoints with server-derived actor and stable product error mapping.
5. Generate OpenAPI contracts and replace raw Organizations/AccessControl usage in Workspace settings.
6. Add owner-facing profile, assignment, invitation, QR, revoke, and replacement UX with mobile coverage.

## Verification

- two workspaces can use the same profile display name without cross-scope reads or writes;
- a non-owner and an owner from another workspace are denied;
- profile permissions cannot exceed the product catalogue or omit required dependencies;
- protected seeds cannot be archived and assigned profiles obey generic concurrency checks;
- member reconciliation cannot target owners, removed members, services, or another workspace;
- list operations batch Workspaces plan reads and remain bounded by page size;
- revoked/disabled sources cannot be replaced before denial succeeds;
- retries cannot mint duplicate replacement sources or replay a previously returned one-time token;
- unit, architecture, PostgreSQL, OpenAPI, web, and multi-account browser workflows pass.

## Implementation Checkpoint

- BunkFy exposes product permission catalogue, profile lifecycle, exact member assignments, and paged join-source management without exposing raw GMA administration APIs.
- Invitation and enrollment-link replacement reuses the source's BunkFy access plan, denies first, and resumes safely after a completed denial by using a caller-supplied replacement id.
- GMA Organizations adds only owner-authorized exact source lookups; replacement policy and access-plan composition remain in BunkFy.
- Focused Workspaces tests cover permission metadata, deny-before-inspect behavior, owner protection, exact assignment reconciliation, batched plan reads, replacement ordering, retry behavior, and one-time token semantics.
- Generated contracts and the owner-facing Workspace settings UX now cover protected/custom roles, member assignments, recipient-aware invitations, reusable team QR sources, lifecycle review, revoke, and deny-first replacement.
- Desktop and 390px mobile preview checks pass. Legacy Organizations invitations without a BunkFy access plan render as lifecycle-only records instead of failing the page.
- The local preview workspace was bootstrapped to seed version `1` with all four product profiles active, zero legacy assignments, and no remaining backfill.
- Remaining work in this task is the real owner/applicant multi-account browser proof and deployment-by-deployment activation evidence.
