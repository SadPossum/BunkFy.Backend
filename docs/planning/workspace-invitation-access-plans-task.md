# Workspace Invitation Access Plans Task

Status: backend, deployed API, and Preview captured-delivery proof complete;
browser and real-provider rehearsal pending

## Goal

Let an authorized workspace manager attach a server-owned Staff/property/access plan to a named invitation or reusable enrollment link. Applicants may review the plan but can never author or broaden authority-bearing fields.

## Ownership

- Organizations owns invitation/enrollment token security, recipient constraints, acceptance, approval, expiry, revocation, rotation, and membership creation.
- AccessControl owns profiles and exact assignment reconciliation.
- Staff owns Staff profiles and property assignments.
- Workspaces owns BunkFy plan state, product validation, provisioning order, retries, and API DTOs.
- GMA Organizations needs a narrow Contracts issuance facade for generic invitation/enrollment creation. It must contain no Staff, property, profile, hostel, or BunkFy vocabulary.

## Plan Rules

- A plan is tenant-scoped and bound to one Organizations source id.
- It stores one active delegable profile id and zero or more active property ids. Reusable links are restricted to configured low-privilege profiles.
- The manager actor must currently possess every delegated permission and property-management authority.
- Applicants receive a sanitized read-only summary. Submission accepts only personal Staff fields.
- Missing, superseded, archived, cross-workspace, or no-longer-delegable plans fail closed.
- Acceptance without a valid plan may create Organizations membership, but membership alone grants no BunkFy operation. Provisioning remains blocked and recoverable.
- Ordinary invitations and reusable links can never grant owner or platform-administration authority.

## Delivery Shape

1. [Complete] Add the provider-neutral Organizations issuance facade with idempotency, recipient/expiry/approval constraints, and one-time token return semantics.
2. [Complete] Add Staff Contracts provisioning for an exact property-assignment plan.
3. [Complete] Persist Workspaces invitation/enrollment plans and bind them to Organizations source ids. Preparation and activation commit before Organizations may mint the one-time token, so there is no fallible BunkFy write after token issuance. An active plan without a corresponding Organizations source grants nothing and is safely retryable.
4. [Complete] Extend Staff onboarding to revalidate and apply Staff data, exact property assignments, the permission-free membership marker, and the selected profile. Missing, inactive, or superseded plans fail closed.
5. [Complete] Invitation and enrollment-link creation endpoints are tenant-scoped and require `staff.manage`. Product-facing list, revoke, replacement, and retry surfaces preserve the Workspaces access-plan boundary; delegated Organizations operations require active membership, operational workspace admission, `staff.manage`, profile visibility, and exact source or claim correlation. Generic raw issuance, reissue, and rotation remain owner-only. Workspace Settings exposes these flows to exactly the evaluated delegated capability without exposing raw Organizations administration.
6. Add sanitized applicant preview and approval summaries.

## Verification

- cross-workspace profile/property ids are rejected;
- actor anti-escalation is rechecked at creation and provisioning time;
- token issuance or plan persistence failure cannot grant product access;
- retry and broker redelivery do not duplicate Staff/property/profile assignments;
- revoked, rotated, expired, and superseded sources cannot provision;
- reusable-link maximum-use and approval races retain one authoritative outcome;
- deployed owner/applicant browser smoke covers password and external registration plus link and QR entry.

Local verification covers aggregate lifecycle and exact replay, owner and delegated-manager anti-escalation, low-privilege reusable-link restrictions, prepare/activate/issue ordering, one-time token replay, endpoint authorization metadata, Staff/property/access retry behavior, migration drift, a PostgreSQL upgrade from the prior Workspaces migration, and the delegated web capability matrix. The browser and broker/restart cases remain deployment gates.

The root deployed invitation and QR enrollment verifiers now cover the public
API boundary with separate identities, property isolation, approval/rejection,
capacity, replay, and exact owner-visible access. The Preview rehearsal also
proves captured verification delivery through private Mailpit on the hardened
runtime. Browser registration and redirect continuity, QR rendering, enabled
external-provider behavior, real-provider delivery, and deployment-controlled
Worker restart remain the explicit root browser rehearsal gate.

## Not In This Slice

- custom role editor UX, delivered separately by `workspace-access-administration-task.md`;
- ownership invitations;
- public guest access;
- adapter/service credentials;
- global Auth account administration.
