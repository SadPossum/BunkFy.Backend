# Guests

Guests owns BunkFy's tenant-wide canonical guest profiles and staff-facing stay history. Guest records never imply authentication, membership, or guest-facing access.

## Current Slice

- bounded profile/contact fields with actor provenance, archive lifecycle, optimistic concurrency, and duplicate-contact allowance;
- property-scoped create, search, read, update, archive, and stay-history surfaces across public management API, Admin API, and Admin CLI;
- visibility through the profile's origin property or a current reservation participant association;
- PII-free profile and reservation/stay integration contracts;
- monotonic stay history that retains inactive replaced links for audit without granting visibility;
- local Properties projection plus task-driven rebuilds for Properties and Reservation stay history;
- PostgreSQL migrations, inbox/outbox, Worker composition, focused tests, and a real PostgreSQL/JetStream saga.

Reservations owns booking roles and current participant links. Guests owns profiles, visibility associations, and its history projection. Neither module writes the other's schema or uses cross-module foreign keys.

Identity documents, consent and retention workflows, duplicate merge/split, entity resolution, guest flags, preferences, and guest accounts remain deferred.
